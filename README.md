The historical sales and computed profit from the adventure works data set shows that the component category is the highest earning category and most profitable. Amongst the three categories, the components category amounts for 48.13% of the total revenue and profit. Followed closely by Bikes at 39.23% and the last is the clothing category with 12.64%. The total revenue was $28.3 Million with contribution from components taking $14.5M, Bikes with $10M and clothing with $3.8M. with the chart above, it shows that there should be a focus on marketing the sales of components and bikes more as they clearly are revenue drivers with a reduction in advertising for clothing.

The visualization gives us a detail look at the education profile of the customers from the sales data. We can see from the above that two educational degrees give the most revenue and profit. The customers with a bachelorâ€™s degree and Partial colleges provide the two highest revenue and profit. There is a marginal difference between the two showing that the company should not sideline their customers that are not fully college graduates. The demographic show they have huge purchasing power even more than graduate or advanced degree holders. This makes some sort of economic sense as the income of the partial college graduates may not serve enough to buy new bikes and they would rather buy components that will be used to enhance or prolong the bikes life usage hence the large sales.

The visualization of the map shows that despite the size and terrain of Canada and the USA, Australia and USA are the most profitable markets for the company in terms of Sales and Profit as USA contributed $9 Million and Australia contributed $8.9 M. The European countries comprising of UK, France and Germany combine to pull in a good amount in sales but the profit from the countries do not worth the additional investment. The VP should look to invest more in the North American and Australian markets given the profits that will be gotten therein.
